This is my professional site and access to my current portfolio. Please click through and take a look at everything in my portfolio!

Used: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, FontAwesome, and little bit of JavaScript

Still to do: Complete the resume and contact pages, move to pagination, rather than separate pages (or move the header and navigation code to another file for export to each page). Possibly, make the side navigation collapsable. Add links to GitHub on the profile page so the code for each project is easily accessible.

Ready for hire

I am a full-stack web developer, specializing in back end, with experience working with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, JQuery, Node.js, MySQL, Express, and React. I take genuine pleasure in a job well done, a problem well solved, a solution well implemented.

I love really looking at the intricacies of a problem and finding the path forward in the creation of top notch programming and development. I am always interested in finding an elegant solution that achieves the desired objectives.
